source code plagiarism can be identified by analyzing similarities of several and diverse aspects of a pair of source code in this paper we present three types of similarity features that account for three aspects of source code documents particularly i lexical ii structural and iii stylistics from the lexical view we used a character 3-gram model without considering reserved words for the programming language in revision for the structural view we proposed two similarity metrics that take into account the func- tion s signatures within a source code namely the data types and the identifier s names of the function s signature the third view consists on accounting for several stylistics features such as the number of white spaces lines of code upper letters etc accordingly we proposed 8 similarity features to represent pairs of source code in order to under a supervised approach identify plagiarized pairs of source codes we use a set of more than 32000 source code documents from java and c to perform our experiments the results show the pertinence of our set of features to identify plagiarism for source code documents that satisfy particular conditions such as source code that solve difficult problems
we investigate an information retrieval ir based approach to source code plagiarism detection the standard method plagiarism detection by extensively checking pairwise sim- ilarities between documents is not scalable to large collec- tions of source code documents to make the task of source code plagiarism detection fast and scalable in practice we propose an ir based approach in this method each doc- ument is treated as a pseudo-query which retrieves a list of documents which are potential candidate for containing plagiarised material in decreasing order of their similarity to the query a threshold is then applied on the relative similarity decrement ratios to create a set of documents as potential cases of source-code reuse instead of treating a source code as an unstructured text document we explore term extraction from the annotated parse tree of a source code and also make use of a field-based language model for indexing and retrieval of source code documents results confirm that source code parsing plays a vital role in im- proving the plagiarism prediction accuracy
plagiarism is a big concern in academia and it can be a problem in every course plagiarism occurs when someone present others work as their own students plagiarize in different areas homework assignments essays projects etc in this work focus is on programming courses and plagiarism in programming assignments while source-code plagiarism detection is in some way very similar to text plagiarism detection it is very different in other ways so a lot of research is done focusing on source-code plagiarism some questions that are researched in this field are what is considered plagiarism in programming assignments how to perform plagiarism detection in programming assignments how to do it automatically what tool s to use how students cheat in programming courses how they try to obfuscate cheating and many other questions this work is a review of important research papers in the field of source-code plagiarism detection in academia this paper tries to answer some of the mentioned research questions and give indication to future work
in programming courses there are various ways in which students attempt to cheat the most commonly used method is copying source code from other students and making minimal changes in it like renaming variable names several tools like sherlock jplag and moss have been devised to detect source code plagiarism however for larger student assignments and projects that involve a lot of source code files these tools are not so effective also issues may occur when source code is given to students in class so they can copy it in such cases these tools do not provide satisfying results and reports in this study we present an improved process model for plagiarism detection when multiple student files exist and allowed source code is present in the research in this paper we use the sherlock detection tool although the presented process model can be combined with any plagiarism detection engine the proposed model is tested on assignments in three courses in two subsequent academic years
there has been much research and discussion relating to variations in plagiaristic activity observed in students from different demographic backgrounds differences in behaviour have been noted in many studies although the underlying reasons are still a matter of debate existing work focuses mainly on textual plagiarism and most often derives results by studying small groups of overseas students studying in a western context this study investigates understanding of source-code plagiarism i e plagiarism of computer programmes amongst university students in china the survey instrument was a chinese translation of a survey previously administered in english in the uk this paper reports the results of the exploratory survey conducted in china and compares these results to those from a parallel survey conducted in the uk the results show that there is a significant difference in understanding between the respondents from the two surveys and suggest topics which a future and more comprehensive study may focus on
source code plagiarism has been a concern for many teachers in computer science field given to the ease of availability of content in this era of internet we developed a tool for detecting plagiarism in source codes of students learning programming languages to cater to the needs of teachers and help them monitor students source codes currently our tool supports six programming languages namely c c java perl python and php the tool works in three steps tokenization followed by n-gram representation of source codes and then comparison using greedy string tiling algorithm response time of our tool is one minute for 50 source code files of length 75 lines of code loc the feedback given by the teachers after using our tool in one of our post graduate courses for advance computing is over whelming as per them results given by the tool are ninety-nine percent correct so we strongly believe that this tool can help to analyse student s true capabilities and help the teachers tremendously in plagiarism detection
source code plagiarism is an easy to do task but very difficult to detect without proper tool support various source code similarity detection systems have been developed to help detect source code plagiarism those systems need to recognize a number of lexical and structural source code modifications for example by some structural modifications e g modification of control structures modification of data structures or structural redesign of source code the source code can be changed in such a way that it almost looks genuine most of the existing source code similarity detection systems can be confused when these structural modifications have been applied to the original source code to be considered effective a source code similarity detection system must address these issues to address them we designed and developed the source code similarity system for plagiarism detection to demonstrate that the proposed system has the desired effectiveness we performed a well-known conformism test the proposed system showed promising results as compared with the jplag system in detecting source code similarity when various lexical or structural modifications are applied to plagiarized code as a confirmation of these results an independent samples t-test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between average values of f-measures for the test sets that we used and for the experiments that we have done in the practically usable range of cut-off threshold values of 35-70
this paper considers the problem of source code plagiarism by students within the computing disciplines and reports the results of a survey of students in computing departments in 18 institutions in the u k this survey was designed to investigate how well students understand the concept of source code plagiarism and to discover what if any specific aspects might cause particular confusion an analysis of the results was carried out to assess understanding by topic and to discover whether various demographic factors may have an influence on that understanding within the survey sample it appeared that the demographic factors tested did not generally affect students understanding of source code plagiarism however analysis of the data for specific topics revealed that there are several areas of activity where the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable behavior is not clearly understood these findings have implications for plagiarism education programs
to detect plagiarism on programming course the plagiarism detection method based on abstract syntax tree ast is proposed first we parse source codes into the corresponding ast by syntax analyzer and a biology sequence matching algorithm is used to calculate the similarities of programs second the ast features of similar parts of the programs are extracted and then space vectors of the features are obtained finally we find copy cluster by clustering the vectors experimental results show that this method has a good effect on the detection of plagiarism and can also find the copy cluster accurately
the educational community across the world is facing the increasing problem of plagiarism the proposed plagiarism detection engine for java pde4java detects code-plagiarism by applying data mining techniques the engine consists of three main phases java tokenisation similarity measurement and clustering it has an optional default tokeniser that makes it flexible to be used with almost any programming language the system provides a visualising representation for each cluster besides the textual representation the simulation results of pde4java showed a comparable performance to that of jplag and it outperformed the expectations when compared to the domain experts findings copyright
plagiarism is a growing problem in academia academics often use plagiarism detection tools to detect similar source-code files once similar files are detected the academic proceeds with the investigation process which involves identifying the similar source-code fragments within them that could be used as evidence for proving plagiarism this paper describes plagate a novel tool that can be integrated with existing plagiarism detection tools to improve plagiarism detection performance the tool also implements a new approach for investigating the similarity between source-code files with a view to gathering evidence for proving plagiarism graphical evidence is presented that allows for the investigation of source-code fragments with regards to their contribution toward evidence for proving plagiarism the graphical evidence indicates the relative importance of the given source-code fragments across files in a corpus this is done by using the latent semantic analysis information retrieval technique to detect how important they are within the specific files under investigation in relation to other files in the corpus
in this paper we compare five tools for detecting plagiarism in java source code texts jplag marble moss plaggie and sim the tools are compared with respect to their features and performance for the performance comparison we carried out two experiments to compare the sensitivity of the tools for different plagiarism techniques we have applied the tools to a set of intentionally plagiarised programs to get a picture of the precision of the tools we have run the tools on several incarnations of a student assignment and compared the top 10 s of the results
jplag is a web service that finds pairs of similar programs among a given set of programs it has successfully been used in practice for detecting plagiarisms among student java program submissions support for the languages c c and scheme is also available we describe jplag s architecture and its comparsion algorithm which is based on a known one called greedy string tiling then the contribution of this paper is threefold first an evaluation of jplag s performance on several rather different sets of java programs shows that jplag is very hard to deceive more than 90 percent of the 77 plagiarisms within our various benchmark program sets are reliably detected and a majority of the others at least raise suspicion the run time is just a few seconds for submissions of 100 programs of several hundred lines each second a parameter study shows that the approach is fairly robust with respect to its configuration parameters third we study the kinds of attempts used for disguising plagiarisms their frequency and their success
plagiarism in universities has always been a difficult problem to overcome various tools have been developed over the past few years to help teachers detect plagiarism in students work by being able to categorize the multitude of plagiarism detection tools it is possible to estimate their capabilities advantages and disadvantages in this article i consider modem plagiarism software solutions paying attention mostly to desktop systems intended for plagiarism detection in program code i also estimate the speed and reliability of different plagiarism detection systems that are currently available
existing source code plagiarism systems focus on the problem of identifying plagiarism between pairs of submissions the task of detection while essential is only a small part of managing plagiarism in an instructional setting holistic plagiarism detection and management requires coordination and sharing of assignment similarity - elevating plagiarism detection from pairwise similarity to cluster-based similarity from a single assignment to a sequence of assignments in the same course and even among instructors of different courses to address these shortcomings we have developed student submissions integrity diagnosis ssid an open-source system that provides holistic plagiarism detection in an instructor-centric way ssid s visuals show overviews of plagiarism clusters throughout all assignments in a course as well as highlighting most-similar submissions on any specific student ssid supports plagiarism detection workflows e g allowing student assistants to flag suspicious assignments for later review and confirmation by an instructor with proper authority evidence is automatically entered into ssid s logs and shared among instructors we have additionally collected a source code plagiarism corpus which we employ to identify and correct shortcomings of previous plagiarism detection engines and to optimize parameter tuning for ssid deployment since its deployment ssid s workflow enhancements have made plagiarism detection in our faculty less tedious and more successful
this paper mainly studies on plagiarism detection method based on the xml similarity and the clustering firstly it analysis the replication types and the copy features of the programming source code secondly extracts the specific code strings and the line positions and then converts it into the xml text thirdly generates a visualization detecting report according to the procedure similarity finally we use the clustering method to identify the plagiarism cluster and the source of the plagiarism
several studies that examine the detection of plagiarism in a given programming environment have recently appeared in the literature in most cases these studies have found support for certain metrics related to program structure as indicative of similarity or plagiarism in the research described in this paper a broader analysis of program similarity and plagiarism is reported the plagiarism detection system developed is shown to be more sensitive than those previously reported in the literature
this paper proposes a novel method to compute how similar two program source codes are since a program source code is represented as a structural form the proposed method adopts convolution kernel functions as a similarity measure actually a program source code has two kinds of structural information one is syntactic information and the other is the dependencies of function calls lying on the program since the syntactic information of a program is expressed as its parse tree the syntactic similarity between two programs is computed by a parse tree kernel the function calls within a program provide a global structure of a program and can be represented as a graph therefore the similarity of function calls is computed with a graph kernel then both structural similarities are reflected simultaneously into comparing program source codes by composing the parse tree and the graph kernels based on a cyclomatic complexity according to the experimental results on a real data set for program plagiarism detection the proposed method is proved to be effective in capturing the similarity between programs the experiments show that the plagiarized pairs of programs are found correctly and thoroughly by the proposed method
vast amounts of information available online make plagiarism increasingly easy to commit and this is particularly true of source code the traditional approach of detecting copied work in a course setting is manual inspection this is not only tedious but also typically misses code plagiarized from outside sources or even from an earlier offering of the course systems to automatically detect source code plagiarism exist but tend to focus on small submission sets one such system that has become the standard in automated source code plagiarism detection is measure of software similarity moss schleimer et al in proceedings of the 2003 acm sigmod international conference on management of data acm san diego 2003 in this work we present an approach called program it yourself piy which is empirically shown to outperform moss in detection accuracy by utilizing parallel processing and data clustering piy is also capable of maintaining detection accuracy and reasonable runtimes even when using extremely large data repositories
this article presents a proposal for the detection of programming source code similitude in academic environments the objective of this proposal is to provide support to professors in detecting plagiarism in student homework assignments in introductory computer programming courses the developed tool codesight is based on a modification of the greedy string tiling algorithm the tool was tested in one theoretical and three real scenarios obtaining similitude detections for assignments ranging from those that contained code without modifications to assignments containing insertions of procedural instructions inside the main code the results verified the efficiency of the tool at the first five levels of the plagiarism spectrum for programming code in addition to supporting suspicions of plagiarism in real scenarios
source-code plagiarism detection in programming concerns the identification of source-code files that contain similar and or identical source-code fragments fuzzy clustering approaches are a suitable solution to detecting source-code plagiarism due to their capability to capture the qualitative and semantic elements of similarity this paper proposes a novel fuzzy-based approach to source-code plagiarism detection based on fuzzy c-means and the adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system anfis in addition performance of the proposed approach is compared to the self- organising map som and the state-of-the-art plagiarism detection running karp-rabin greedy-string-tiling rkr-gst algorithms the advantages of the proposed approach are that it is programming language independent and hence there is no need to develop any parsers or compilers in order for the fuzzy-based predictor to provide detection in different programming languages the results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based approach overcomes all other approaches on well-known source code datasets and reveals promising results as an efficient and reliable approach to source-code plagiarism detection
unauthorized re-use of code by students is a widespread problem in academic institutions and raises liability issues for industry manual plagiarism detection is time-consuming and current effective plagiarism detection approaches cannot be easily scaled to very large code repositories while there are practical text-based plagiarism detection systems capable of working with large collections this is not the case for code-based plagiarism detection in this paper we propose techniques for detecting plagiarism in program code using text similarity measures and local alignment through detailed empirical evaluation on small and large collections of programs we show that our approach is highly scalable while maintaining similar levels of effectiveness to that of the popular jplag and moss systems copyright
the problem of plagiarism in programming assignments by students in computer science courses has caused considerable concern among both faculty and students there are a number of methods which instructors use in an effort to control the plagiarism problem in this paper we describe a plagiarism detection system which was recently implemented in our department this system is being used to detect similarities in student programs

the assessment of programming courses is usually carried out by means of programming assignments since it is simple to copy and edit computer programs however there will always be a temptation among some students following such courses to copy and modify the work of others as the number of students in these courses is often high it can be very difficult to detect this plagiarism the authors have developed a package which will allow programming assignments to be submitted online and which includes software to assist in detecting possible instances of plagiarism in this paper they discuss the concerns that motivated this work describe the developed software tailoring the software to different requirements and finally consider its implications for large group teaching
in this study an online compiler and a source code plagiarism detection tool have been included into the moodle based distance education system of our computer engineering department for this purpose moodle system has been extended with the gcc compiler and the moss source code plagiarism detection tool we observed that using the online compiler and the plagiarism detection tool reduces time and effort needed for the assessment of the programming assignments prevents our students from plagiarism and increases their success in their programming based data structures course
student plagiarism is a major problem in universities worldwide in this paper we focus on plagiarism in answers to computer programming assignments where students mix and or modify one or more original solutions to obtain counterfeits although several software tools have been developed to help the tedious and time consuming task of detecting plagiarism little has been done to assess their quality because determining the real authorship of the whole submission corpus is practically impossible for markers in this paper we present a grammar evolution technique which generates benchmarks for testing plagiarism detection tools given a programming language our technique generates a set of original solutions to an assignment together with a set of plagiarisms of the former set which mimic the basic plagiarism techniques performed by students the authorship of the submission corpus is predefined by the user providing a base for the assessment and further comparison of copy-catching tools we give empirical evidence of the suitability of our approach by studying the behavior of one advanced plagiarism detection tool ac on four benchmarks coded in apl2 generated with our technique
this paper describes a classroom experiment in which detected cases of programming plagiarism were correlated with the classroom s social network the results suggest that it is possible to understand the amount of similarity between artifacts as an indirect measure of the student social network these findings imply that it is possible to uncover the classroom social network using only the source code produced by the students the proposed method may be used as an instrument for considering and applying social techniques to improve student learning this research is the first step in redefining the role of plagiarism detection in the programming assessment process as an effective learning intervention tool as opposed to a simple disciplinary procedure
the paper is devoted to the presentation of an application detecting similarities in shorter program codes it helps to reveal plagiarism wide-spread among students the application is available online it enables to share information among several teachers and their reciprocal cooperation
this paper presents a novel dynamic analysis approach to software plagiarism detection such an approach is inherently more resilient to code obfuscation techniques such as renaming of program entities reordering of statements etc we develop our technique in the context of a dynamic analysis and visualization system for java called jive but the techniques are applicable to other object-oriented languages our analyses are based on the execution traces of java programs produced by jive and our experimental results confirm that this approach is both efficient and effective in detecting plagiarism of java programs when their source codes are not available

plagiarism is a well known problem of today s society widespread of the internet ease of data exchange bologna reforms and individual circumstances influence on students to resort to plagiarism many courses in computer science where students have programming assignments suffer from so called source code plagiarism beside the internet most common origins of solved assignments are fellow students from the same or the previous generation in this paper the source code plagiarism is discussed main results from observing the plagiarism in programming assignments are given showing to which extent students plagiarize
we illustrate the state of the art in software plagiarism detection tools by comparing their features and testing them against a wide range of source codes the source codes were edited according to several types of plagiarism to show the tools accuracy at detecting each type the decision to focus our research on plagiarism of programming languages is two fold on one hand it is a challenging case-study since programming languages impose a structured writing style on the other hand we are looking for the integration of such a tool in an automatic-grading system ags developed to support teachers in the context of programming courses besides the systematic characterisation of the underlying problem domain the tools were surveyed with the objective of identifying the most successful approach in order to design the aimed plugin for our ags
similarity detection tools are nowadays commonly used by instructors to prevent student cheating and to enforce academic integrity systems identifying similarity in programming assignments are generally classified as either attribute-based or structure-based systems attribute-based methods make statistical analysis of the program attributes to detect lexical changes whereas structure-based methods complete a deeper analysis of the program structure to detect hidden structural similarities both methods can be useful for student programming assignments which consist generally of small to medium size source codes in this paper we introduce a method that encompasses both approaches to fit characteristics of student java programming assignments similarities between pairs of programs can be detected by either profiling their source codes and measuring their distance or parsing them and comparing their encodings using a method inspired by dna sequencing we describe our experimental prototype called caplag computing assignment plagiarism and illustrate the results of some exploratory experiments we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately find similarities in java programs by comparing our results against those obtained with jplag a web based service and show that our system can be useful for instructors to deal with different programming assignment cases
student perceptions of academic integrity have been extensively researched in relation to text-based assessments but there is rather less research relating to non-text-based assessments such as computer programs databases and spreadsheets this paper reports the findings from a survey of computing students and academics to investigate perceptions of particular academic practices with regard to both essays and computing assessments for each practice the research sought to discover whether it was perceived to constitute plagiarism or collusion and whether it was considered to be acceptable in an academic environment while there was general agreement between academics and students regarding some practices both groups displayed high levels of uncertainty about other practices there was considerable variation between their attitudes to similar practices in the text and non-text environments and between what was seen as plagiarism collusion and perceptions of unacceptability that is there were practices that were perceived to be plagiarism or collusion but were considered acceptable and others that were considered not to be plagiarism or collusion but were nevertheless thought unacceptable these findings suggest a need for academic integrity policies and procedures specific to computing accompanied by discipline-specific student education copyright
technology empowers students but can also entice them to plagiarise to tackle this problem plagiarism detection tools are especially useful not only in popular thinking as a deterrent for students but also as an educational tool to raise students awareness of the offence and to improve their academic skills commercial text matching tools e g turnitin are at a high level of maturity these tools offer the ability to interact with students making them suitable for an educational objective additionally they can be readily integrated into learning environments enabling uniform application at an institutional level on the other hand computer source code matching tools despite their successful detection performance are mostly used as standalone tools that are difficult to adopt at an institutional level the research presented in this paper describes the trial and evaluation of a tool that is seamlessly integrated into the moodle virtual learning environment the tool provides code similarity scanning capability within moodle so that institutions using this learning environment could apply this tool easily at an enterprise level additionally the educational aspects available in text matching tools have been added into the tool capability the tool relies on two popular code matching services moss and jplag as underlying engines to provide good code similarity scanning performance the evaluation of the tool from both academics and students perspectives indicates a considerable level of interest in using the tool and supports the suitability of this tool for wider institutional adoption in the computing education community
in this paper a plagiarism detection framework is proposed based on coding style furthermore the typical style-based approach is improved to better detect plagiarism in programming codes the plagiarism detection is performed in two phases in the first phase the main features representing a coding style are extracted in the second phase the extracted features are used in three different modules to detect the plagiarized codes and to determine the giver and takers of the codes the extracted features for each code developer are kept in a history log i e a user profile as his her style of coding and would be used to determine the change in coding style the user profile allows the system to detect if a code is truly developed by the claimed developer or it is written by another person having another style furthermore the user profile allows determining the code giver and code taker when two codes are similar by comparing the codes styles with the style of the programmers also if a code is copied from the internet or developed by a third party then the style of who claims the ownership of the code is normally less proficient in coding than the third party and can be detected the difference between the style levels is done through the style level checker module in the proposed framework the proposed framework has been implemented and tested and the results are compared to moss which shows comparable performance in detecting plagiarized codes
plagiarism is a widespread problem in assessment tasks in computing courses students often plagiarise source code for all but the smallest classes manual detection of such plagiarism is impractical and while automated tools are available none has been applied to detect inter-lingual plagiarism where source code is copied from one language to another in this work we propose a novel approach xplag to detect plagiarism involving multiple languages using intermediate program code produced by a compiler suite we describe experiments to evaluate xplag and show that we can detect inter-lingual plagiarism with reasonably good precision copyright
in the instruction of computer courses some students copy other other s source code as themselves in order to detect this plagiarism accurately researchers did a lot in this paper we described a source code plagiarism detection technologe based on ast this technologe can detect the plagiarism accurately when the position of functions is changed by plagiarist at first transforming the programs to the ast using antlr and then abstracting the function subtree subtrees from the ast at last compare the function subtree using lcs get the simalarity between programs
studies have shown that many students have similar programs in programming class most of which due to plagiarism students may simply modify others programs as their own this makes the assessment standards for students programs with lots of ambiguity and uncertainty limiting assessment accuracy and efficiency and reducing the reliability of test results to solve this problem a student program plagiarism detection approach is proposed based on a data mining algorithm firstly similar code fragments are mined by the clospan algorithm then similarities between programs are calculated finally the plagiarism list is output experiments showed that compared with the widely used plagiarism detection tool moss our approach is can not only more accurately give statistical information of the similar program detected but also be able to visualize the similar code fragments which can greatly increase detection efficiency
we have often seen how malware families evolve over time the malware authors add new features change the order of functions modify some strings or add random useless code they do all that to evade detection in a similar way computer science students that copy homework will change variable and function names rephrase comments or even replace some small portions of the code in both cases the essence remains the same and it is easy for one to see it by comparing two samples or two source codes the challenge however is to automatically find groups of similar items in a large collection our research shows that we can apply the same techniques in order to cluster new malicious samples into malware families and detect plagiarized students work the paper proposes a novel approach for computing the similarity between two items based not only on their features but also based on the frequencies of those features in a given population the new similarity function was tested in a clustering algorithm and it proved better than other approaches also the nature of the method allows it to be used in other document classification tasks
clone detection is usually applied in the context of detecting small-to medium scale fragments of duplicated code in large software systems in this paper we address the problem of clone detection applied to plagiarism detection in the context of source code assignments done by computer science students plagiarism detection comes with a distinct set of constraints to usual clone detection approaches which influenced the design f the approach we present in this paper for instance the source code can be heavily changed at a superficial level in an attempt to look genuine yet be functionally very similar since assignments turned in by computer science students can be in a variety of languages we work at the syntactic level and do not consider the source-code semantics consequently the approach we propose is endogenous and makes no assumption about the programming language being analysed it is based on an alignment method using the parallel principle at local resolution character level to compute similarities between documents we tested our framework on hundreds of real source files involving a wide array of programming languages java c python php haskell bash our approach allowed us to discover previously undetected frauds and to empirically evaluate its accuracy and robustness
latent semantic analysis lsa is an intelligent information retrieval technique that uses mathematical algorithms for analyzing large corpora of text and revealing the underlying semantic information of documents lsa isahighly parameterized statistical method and its effectiveness is driven by the setting of its parameters which are adjusted based on the task to which it is applied this paper discusses and evaluates the importance of parameterization for lsa based similarity detection of source-code documents and the applicability of lsa asatechnique for source-code plagiarism detection when its parameters are appropriately tuned the parameters involve preprocessing techniques weighting approaches and parameter tweaking inherent to lsa processing-in particular the choice of dimensions for the step of reducing the original post-svd matrix the experiments revealed that the best retrieval performance is obtained after removal of in-code comments java comment blocks and applyingacombined weighting scheme based on term frequencies normalized term frequencies and acosine-based document normalization furthermore the use of similarity thresholds instead of mere rankings requires the use ofahigher number of dimensions
programming assignments are usually considered as a major assessment component of a programming course as the number of students enrolling in programming courses has been always high it becomes a difficult task to mark a large number of programming assignments effectively in a short period of time moreover plagiarism on program codes has become a serious problem recently markers may not be able to locate similar scripts that they have marked before this paper introduces an online assignment management system which allows programming assignments to be submitted online and marked effectively the marking of programming assignments involves two processes plagiarism detection among different submitted source codes and automatic marking of individual assignment which includes program testing on different test cases and checking across the model answer in this paper we propose the use of parse tree for checking the similarity between program codes the method can be employed in plagiarism detection and automatic marking of programming assignments
in this paper a plagiarism detection model based on xml is introduced to detect similarities among programs based upon the syntax of a specific programming language the key structure which can represent the procedural structure is picked out from c program then using xml text represent c program according to different key structure we design the different similarity comparison algorithm to calculate the procedural similarity finally the usefulness of the detection of plagiarism is discussed
the paper shows the possibility of analyzing programming code similarity by using intermediate language intermediate language that is generated by compiler is not sensitive to different kind of common code transformations like changing variable names modifications of some language constructs and loops therefore the changes in original source code result in lesser changes in intermediate language code that has positive effect on the results of code similarity analysis paper proposes a method for determining the similarity of programming code and relies on existing and efficient string similarity algorithms method s performance is shown by analyzing source code of applications submitted by students as their homework the paper describes method s advantages and disadvantages and suggests future steps to improve its results and accuracy
in recent years most of source code plagiarism detection systems are based on pairwise comparing representations of the program structures called structure-metric systems however these systems have limitations in this study a markov model based source code plagiarism detection tool is proposed called mplag to cope with the limitations it applies markov models to students coding process data recorded while writing a program to detect plagiarism mplag reduces the probability of obtaining the false positives caused by coincident similarities in addition mplag improves scalability by reducing the time complexity from o n2 to o n furthermore mplag is programming language independent and provides robust evidence for proving plagiarism by replaying a student s coding process the experimental results revealed that mplag had high effectiveness in detecting complex programs as well as in detecting simpler programs
software plagiarism is a growing and serious problem that affects computer science universities in particular and the quality of education in general more and more students tend to copy their thesis s software from older theses or internet databases checking source codes manually to detect if they are similar or the same is a laborious and time consuming job maybe even impossible due to existence of large digital repositories ontology is a way of describing a document s semantic so it can be easily used for source code files too owl web ontology language could find its applicability in describing both vocabulary and taxonomy of a programming language sparql is a query language based on sql that extracts saved or deducted information from ontologies including complex data based on algebraic logic our paper proposes a source code plagiarism detection method based on ontology mapping that can be applied in scanning students bachelor s or master s degree theses software source code
in this paper we propose different representations of a source code which attempt to highlight different aspects of a code particularly i lexical ii structural and iii stylistics for the lexical view we used levenshtein distance without considering all reserved words of the programming language for the structural view we proposed a similarity metric that takes into account the function s signatures and variable declaration within a source code the third view consists of several stylistic features such as the number of white spaces lines of code upper case letters etc at the end we combine these different representations in several ways obtained results indicate that proposed representations provide some information that allows to detect particular cases of source code re-use
source code plagiarism is easy to commit but difficult to catch many approaches have been proposed in the literature to automate its detection however there is little consensus on what works best in this paper we propose two new measures for determining the accuracy of a given technique and describe an approach to convert code files into strings which can then be compared for similarity in order to detect plagiarism we then compare several string comparison techniques heavily utilised in the area of biological sequence alignment and compare their performance on a large collection of student source code containing various types of plagiarism experimental results show that the compared techniques succeed in matching a plagiarised file to its original files upwards of 90 of the time finally we propose a modification for these algorithms that drastically improves their runtimes with little or no effect on accuracy even though the ideas presented herein are applicable to most programming languages we focus on a case study pertaining to an introductory-level visual basic programming course offered at our institution
measuring program similarity plays an important role in solving many problems in software engineering however because programs are instruction sequences with complex structures and semantic functions and furthermore programs may be obfuscated deliberately through semantics-preserving transformations measuring program similarity is a difficult task that has not been adequately addressed in this paper we propose a new approach to measuring java program similarity the approach first measures the low-level similarity between basic blocks according to the bytecode instruction sequences and the structural property of the basic blocks then an error-tolerant graph matching algorithm that can combat structure transformations is used to match the control flow graphs cfg based on the basic block similarity the high-level similarity between java programs is subsequently calculated on the matched pairs of the independent paths extracted from the optimal cfg matching the proposed cfg-match approach is compared with a string-based approach a tree-based approach and a graph-based approach experimental results show that the cfg-match approach is more accurate and robust against semantics-preserving transformations the cfg-match approach is used to detect java program plagiarism experiments on the collection of benchmark program pairs collected from the students submission of project assignments demonstrate that the cfg-match approach outperforms the comparative approaches in the detection of java program plagiarism
background objectives rising plagiarism incidences among students has become a common source of stress for academic community this research is undertaken to reduce plagiarism in programming labs of universities across globe faculty evaluation system development and to remove social media use in labs methods statistical analysis students of 21st century copy and exchange software codes available online with each other and at times even pay third-parties for timely submission of lab-assignments they feel exchanging assignments with others maintain their social rapport image among their friends our research initiated with hawk-eye that s a mobile based plagiarism detection system easy to handle and maintain by further research we had observed that hawk-eye combination with cohort-intelligence ci would lead to design of more reliable plagiarism evaluation system as hawk s penetrating eyesight help in successful plagiarism detection and ci self-supervising nature helps to prevent students plagiarized behavior findings the key motivation behind writing this paper is to highlight the fact that plagiarism in today s cyber age is contributing as a global business option in academic areas so the design of evaluation systems in universities should be flexible enough to lessen the overall incidence of plagiarism and motivating its students for not breaking university rules and regulations applications improvements hawk eye along with ci would prove to be an efficient system to design an incrementally learning evaluation system as a measure in universities to stop plagiarism that would continue to evolve every year with new semester
in programming language courses programming exercises and assignments are typical measurable tasks used to determine the skills and knowledge of students on the respective programming language on the other hand widespread access to the internet has served as something of a double-edged sword with respect to plagiarism appearance in exercises assignments etc we present a viable architecture implementing plagiarism detection and decision in a programming laboratory environment the proposed architecture could be realized as an extension of an already implemented diagnosing and evaluation system for laboratory based academic exercises which exploits the legacy system as well as the already existing plagiarism detection tools such as moss or jplag we combine the input of plagiarism detection tools with the corresponding logging information of the existing monitoring and tracing subsystem of the legacy system in order to conclude in a safer manner whether a case of potential plagiarism indeed is plagiarism or not
we propose a methodology using abstract syntax trees for the detection of plagiarism in source code within an academic environment we show the architecture and decisions that came before we produce our own solution spector after conducting a study of the methods and tools in existence an example is then shown which goes through and explains each of the algorithms steps finally conclusions are drawn noting that such a system while not the most efficient produces accurate results
computing education usually involves intensive practical training through laboratory exercises programming projects and homework assignments those assignments are frequent targets for plagiarism in this paper we discuss social and educational aspects of the source code plagiarism in academic environment and present an overview of software tools for source code similarity detection we present our experiences with jplag moss and spd tools and compare them using simulated plagiarism based on programming assignment solutions produced after 1 2 4 and 8 hours of work on baseline version using more than 20 types of lexical and structural modifications that students use to hide plagiarism we also compare results of the selected tools used on real-life student programming solutions from three different courses the courses were attended by 100 to 300 students and the programming assignment solutions varied in size and complexity from 50 to 1000 lines of source code the results show that 5-10 of students plagiarized their solutions in our experience jplag and moss proved to be effective tools for plagiarism detection as they clearly indicated cases of similarity which were manually confirmed by human code inspection
this paper summarizes the goals organization and results of the first soco competitive evaluation campaign for systems that automatically detect the source code re-use phenomenon the detection of source code re-use is an important research field for both software industry and academia fields accordingly pan fire track named source code re-use soco focused on the detection of re-used source codes in c c and java programming languages participant systems were asked to annotate several source codes whether or not they represent cases of source code re-use in total five teams submitted 17 runs the training set consisted of annotations made by several experts a feature which turns the soco 2014 collection in a useful data set for future evaluations and at the same time it establishes a standard evaluation framework for future research works on the posed shared task
plagiarism is a common problem in education and detecting it is a very difficult task if a marker is responsible for marking only some of the scripts the situation becomes worse for distance learning as some students are allowed to submit assignments after the due dates and markers may have to mark assignments over quite a long period of time they might forget similar scripts that they marked some time before this chapter introduces an integrated online assessment system for markers to detect plagiarism of program codes in a more structured less computational and more flexible way we propose a new algorithm using parse tree for detecting plagiarism of programming codes the use of parse tree introduces a structured and systematic way for detecting similarities among computer programs the assessment system provides multiple features to aid in the effective marking of assignments such as plagiarism detection automatic program testing and students performance statistics the aim of these features is to relieve the burden of teaching staff and provide an alternative way to paper-based marking
in today s digital era information access is just a click away so computer science students also have easy access to all the source codes from different websites thus it has become difficult for academicians to detect source code reuse in students programming assignments the new trend in the area of source code reuse is using the source code by translating it in another programming language popularly known as cross language plagiarism our clscr addresses this problem clscr mainly has two components a compiler that compiles and translates the language specific source code into a tool specific internal format and the similarity calculator that computes similarity between internal formats of different programs
plagiarism in online learning environments has a detrimental e ect on the trust of online courses and their viability automatic plagiarism detection systems do exist yet the speci c situation in online courses restricts their use to allow for easy automated grading online assignments usually are less open and instead require students to ll in small gaps therefore solutions tend to be very similar yet are then not necessarily plagiarized in this paper we propose a new approach to detect code re-use that increases the prediction accuracy by dynamically removing parts in assignments which are part of almost every assignment the so called common ground our approach shows signi cantly better f-measure and cohen s results than other state of the art algorithms such as moss or jplag the proposed method is also language agnostic to the point that training and test data sets can be taken from di erent programming languages
tools for algorithmically detecting plagiarism have become very popular but none of these tools offers an effective and reliable way to identify plagiarism within academic software development as a result the identification of plagiarism within programming submissions remains an issue of academic judgment the number of submissions that come in to a large programming class can frustrate the ability to fully investigate each submission for conformance with academic norms of attribution it is necessary for academics to investigate misconduct but time and logistical considerations likely make it difficult if not impossible to ensure full coverage of all solutions in such cases a subset of submissions may be analyzed and these are often the submissions that have most readily come to mind as containing suspect elements in this paper the authors discuss some of the issues with regards to identifying plagiarism within programming modules and the ethical issues that these raise the paper concludes with some personal reflections on how best to deal with the complexities so as to ensure fairer treatment for students and fairer coverage of submissions
cheating in computer science classes can damage the reputation of institutions and their students it is therefore essential to routinely authenticate student submissions with available software plagiarism detection algorithms such as measure of software similarity moss scaling this task for large classes where assignments are repeated each semester adds complexity and increases the instructor workload the moss tool for addressing plagiarism at scale moss-taps organizes the moss submission task in courses that repeat coding assignments in a recent use-case in the online master of science in computer science omscs program at the georgia institute of technology the instructor time spent was reduced from 50 hours to only 10 minutes using the managed submission tool design presented here moss-taps provides persistent configuration supports a mixture of software languages and file organizations and is implemented in pure java for cross-platform compatibility
the advent of the internet has caused an increase in content reuse including source code the purpose of this research is to uncover potential cases of source code reuse in large-scale environments a good example is academia where massive courses are taught to students who must demonstrate that they have acquired the knowledge the need of detecting content reuse in quasi real-time encourages the development of automatic systems such as the one described in this paper for source code reuse detection our approach is based on the comparison of programs at character level it is able to find potential cases of reuse across a huge number of assignments it achieved better results than jplag the most used online system to find similarities among multiple sets of source codes the most common obfuscation operations we found were changes in identifier names comments and indentation

plagiarism is one form of academic dishonesty which is often done by students in programming classes in a large class detecting plagiarism manually is both difficult and time-consuming especially due to the numerous modifications of the source code to conceal the cheating we designed and developed deimos a prototype of a source code plagiarism detector which can be extended to handle other programming languages simply by implementing new scanners and parsers deimos works in two steps 1 parsing source code and transforming it into tokens and then 2 comparing each pair of token strings obtained in the first step using running karp-rabin greedy string tiling algorithm instructor can access deimos via a web application interface that receives input parameters triggers a background process and displays the result the web interface offers user friendliness while the background process prevents timeout and reduces bandwidth consumption this approach was chosen since deimos is intended to be used for processing more than 100 source code the web application was implemented using php while java was used to implement the backend application which is responsible for the background process unit test functional test and nonfunctional test has been conducted detection time is 1 hour for processing 100 samples of beginner s source code taken from real assignment of our programming class where the average length of source code is 150 lines this code similarity detector could also be used for other pedagogical tools such as autograder which checks consistency of source code based on a template or solution
most plagiarism detection systems evaluate the similarity of source codes and detect plagiarized program pairs if we use the source codes in plagiarism detection the source code security can be a significant problem plagiarism detection based on target code can be used for protecting the security of source codes in this paper we propose a new plagiarism detection technique for java programs using bytecodes without referring their source codes the plagiarism detection procedure using bytecode consists of two major steps first we generate the token sequences from the java class file by analyzing the code area of methods then we evaluate the similarity between token sequences using the adaptive local alignment according to the experimental results we can find the distributions of similarities of the source codes and that of bytecodes are very similar also the correlation between the similarities of source code pairs and those of bytecode pairs is high enough for typical test data the plagiarism detection system using bytecode can be used as a preliminary verifying tool before detecting the plagiarism by source code comparison
the online course management system ocms assists online instruction in various aspects including testing course discussion assignment submission and assignment grading this paper proposes a plagiarism detection system whose design is integrated with an ocms online assignment submission is prone to easy plagiarism which can seriously influence the quality of learning in the past plagiarism was detected manually making it very time-consuming this research thus focuses on developing a system involving code standardization textual analysis structural analysis and variable analysis for evaluating and comparing programming codes an agent system serves as a daemon to analyze the program codes for ocms for textual analysis the fingerprinting algorithm was used for text comparison structurally a formal algebraic expression and a dynamic control structure tree dcs tree were utilized to rebuild and evaluate the program structure for variables not only the relevant information for each variable was recorded but also the programming structure was analyzed where the variables are positioned by applying a similarity measuring method a similarity value was produced for each program in the three aspects mentioned above this research implements an online detection plagiarism system odps providing a web-based user interface this system can be applied independently for assignment analysis of java programs after three comparison experiments with other researches the results demonstrated the odps has many advantages and good performance meanwhile a combined approach is proven that it is better than a single approach for source codes of various styles

plagiarism in programming assignments in computer science courses is on the rise mainly due to recent innovation in computer technology which has made copying sharing and modifying a document effortless detecting plagiarism in computer programs through manual inspection process is very error-prone since a plagiarist can easily produce a program with a whole different look through some clever text substitution and rearrangement of statements in addition the detection process is very time-consuming this paper introduces and discusses different techniques of automatic screening and detection of plagiarism that can be used as aids to detect and deter plagiarism in computer programming courses the paper also presents a simple screening and detection scheme based on statistical techniques
the large class sizes typical for an undergraduate programming course mean that it is nearly impossible for a human marker to accurately detect plagiarism particularly if some attempt has been made to hide the copying while it would be desirable to be able to detect all possible code transformations we believe that there is a minimum level of acceptable performance for the application of detecting student plagiarism it would be useful if the detector operated at a level that meant for a piece of work to fool the algorithm would require that the student spent a large amount of time on the assignment and had a good enough understanding to do the work without plagiarising
plagiarism detection in software programs is very important in both academia and industry there are many tools available today to aid in detecting plagiarism in text and source documents most of the plagiarism detection tools for source code do some sort of pre-processing like removing comments blank spaces and using uniform tokens for primitive types variables before actually applying intelligent matching techniques so that the tool can detect the copied code even if it is changed in format and variable names etc in this paper we propose a novel preprocessing approach based on design patterns such that any code that is intelligently plagiarized can also be easily located

plagiarism in programming courses is a pervasive and frustrating problem that undermines the educational process defining plagiarism is difficult because of the fuzzy boundary between allowable peer-peer collaboration and plagiarism pursuing suspected plagiarism has attendant emotional and legal risks to the student and teacher with the teacher bearing the burden of proof in this paper we present a metrics-based system for monitoring similarities between programs and for gathering the preponderance of evidence needed to pursue suspected plagiarism anonymous results from monitoring are posted to create a climate in which the issue of plagiarism is discussed openly
in the light of recent press coverage of wolverhampton university s attempts to sensitise students and staff to the dangers of copying and plagiarism in assessed coursework it is timely to look at one facet of this problem peculiar to software engineering namely the copying of source code by novice programmers especially those novice programmers on high-volume modular programmes of study this paper attempts to review the issue of plagiarism and copying from a wide variety of angles and in the light of this review draws on informal surveys and ongoing project work at wolverhampton to highlight possible improvements the paper starts by reviewing the most general factors that influence academic misdemeanors these factors are common to all subjects and cover not only the institutional climate and its regulatory framework b
in this paper we introduce an evaluation system for identifying program similarity by comparing syntax-trees for the given programs by using syntax-trees this system is capable of distinguishing plagiarism in spite of changes in program styles such as indent white space and comments it can also recognize plagiarism patterns resulting from changes in program structure such as statement exchanges code block and function syntax-trees are created after program parsing so they have the advantage of performing syntax and semantic analysis automatically we also introduce an evaluation algorithm for program similarity and a grouping algorithm for the sake of reducing the count of comparisons the experiment and estimation proves that a grouping algorithm can reduce a lot of counts of comparison

in academic courses students frequently take advantage of someone else s work to improve their own evaluations or grades this unethical behavior seriously threatens the integrity of the academic system and teachers invest substantial effort in preventing and recognizing plagiarism when students take examinations requiring the production of computer programs plagiarism detection can be semiautomated using analysis techniques such as jplag and moss these techniques are useful but lose effectiveness when the text of the exam suggests some of the elements that should be structurally part of the solution a loss of effectiveness is caused by the many common parts that are shared between programs due to the suggestions in the text of the exam rather than plagiarism in this article we present the audentes anti-plagiarism technique audentes detects plagiarism via the code fragments that better represent the individual students contributions by filtering from students submissions the parts thatmight be common tomany students due to the suggestions in the text of the exam the filtered parts are identified by comparing students submissions against a reference solution which is a solution of the exam developed by the teachers specifically audentes first produces tokenized versions of both the reference solution and the programs that must be analyzed then audentes removes from the tokenized programs the tokens that are included in the tokenized reference solution finally audentes computes the similarity among the filtered tokenized programs and produces a ranked list of program pairs suspected of plagiarism an empirical comparison against multiple state-of-the-art plagiarism detection techniques using several sets of real students programs collected in early programming courses demonstrated that audentes identifies more plagiarism cases than the other techniques at the cost of a small additional inspection effort

a system for the automatic generation of plagiarism detectors that find similar programs in a set of student programs is presented existing plagiarism detectors are either applied to a programming language or a pre-defined set of programming languages the general purpose one usually employs string matching to perform similarity measures that are based on plagiarism detection among documents in general and not in programs in particular thus losing much of the structure and logic of programs in the process on the other hand plagiarism detectors for specific languages only cater to that particular set of languages this study provides a means for the user to specify the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed moreover an automatic plagiarism detector system must be immune to the transformations that students perform on copied programs these transformations are usually dependent on several factors namely the type of programming problems and correspondingly the complexity of the project to be implemented by the students and also the programming language paradigm of the programs thus the similarity measures employed by the system should be determined by these factors and can be specified by the professor he she has the option to specify how the similarities among the student programs will be captured the system provides an interface for the specification of the particular programming language in which the student programs are implemented and a knowledgebase of similarity measures that the user would like to include in the analysis of the student programs hence the system provides flexibility in the programming language of the student programs to be analyzed and the similarity measures that the professor wishes to employ initial qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate a flexible convenient and cost-effective tool for building plagiarism detectors for effective detection of programs in various imperative and procedural p- - rogramming languages the approach also addresses some of the changes that students perform on copied programs which jplag fails to handle thus allowing for improved accuracy in terms of the reduction of false-positives increasing the chance of catching plagiarized programs these changes include modification of control structures use of temporary variables and subexpressions in-lining and re-factoring of methods and redundancy variables or methods that were not used comprehensive tests on other programming languages under various programming language paradigms such as object-oriented logic and functional languages considering the different changes that the students employ to copied programs such as the tests done in jplag are also recommended for empirical evaluation
program assignments are traditionally an area of serious concern in maintaining the integrity of the educational process systematic inspection of all solutions for possible plagiarism has generally required unrealistic amounts of time and effort the measure of software similarity tool developed by alex aiken at uc berkeley makes it possible to objectively and automatically check all solutions for evidence of plagiarism the authors have used moss in several large sections of a c programming course moss can also handle a variety of other languages they feel that moss is a major innovation for faculty who teach programming and recommend that it be used routinely to screen for plagiarism
laboratory work assignments are very important for computer science learning over the last 12 years many students have been involved in solving such assignments in the authors department having reached a figure of more than 400 students doing the same assignment in the same year this number of students has required teachers to pay special attention to conceivable plagiarism cases a plagiarism detection tool has been developed as part of a full toolset for helping in the management of the laboratory work assignments this tool defines and uses four similarity criteria to measure how similar two assignment implementations are the paper describes the plagiarism detection tool and the experience of using it over the last 12 years in four different programming assignments from microprogramming a cpu to system programming in c

this paper proposes a method to automatically detect plagiarisms i e illegal copies among a set of programs submitted by students in elementary programming courses in such courses programming assignments are so simple that submitted programs are very short and similar to each other existing plagiarism detection methods therefore may yield many false positive results the proposed method solves the problem by using three types of similarity code comment and inconsistence the inconsistence similarity a unique feature of the method improves the precision and recall ratios and helps to find evidences of plagiarisms evaluation results using real student program assignments show the effectiveness of the proposed method
nowadays the research of software homology detection is more and more important in the flourishing software market most of the existing detection tools are based on text structure but ignore the syntax framework structure of program codes a few tools based on syntax structure do not consider detection on semantics level which can be avoided by some plagiarism the comparison system put forward in this paper combines comparison methods based on abstract syntax tree and simple semantics such that being able to detect the homology software more accurately and comprehensively it not only analyses the syntax structure of program codes but also researches some simple semantics changes to achieve detection on both syntax and semantics level based on these a homology detection system code compare is developed compared with other detection tools code compare is capable of recognizing more code plagiarism types thus can detect homology software more effectively

holmes is a plagiarism detection tool for haskell programs in this paper we describe holmes and show that it can detect plagiarism in a substantial corpus 2 122 haskell submissions spread over 18 different assignments of haskell programs submitted by undergraduate students in a undergraduate level functional programming course over a period of ten years and consider its sensitivity to superficial changes in the source code
analyzing and grading programs in an introductory computer science course can require a great deal of time and effort from the course instructor this paper investigates the development of a system called instructional tool for program advising itpad that assumes some of the instructor s duties by keeping student profiles and assignment profiles by detecting possible plagiarism and by providing suggestions directly to the students for improving their programs the design of the itpad system is based mainly on the direct application of code optimization techniques to fortran source programs several software science measures also provide some of the profile characteristics the results of test runs show that this system helps the instructor monitor the progress of the students through the term and also helps the instructor determine the individual algorithmic approaches for a particular programming assignment the system can further benefit the students directly by providing suggestions that emphasize the use of good programming style
detecting whether computer program code is a student s original work or has been copied from another student or some other source is a major problem for many universities detection methods based on the information retrieval concepts of indexing and similarity matching scale well to large collections of files but require appropriate similarity functions for good performance we have used particle swarm optimization and genetic programming to evolve similarity functions that are suited to computer program code using a training set of plagiarised and non-plagiarised programs we have evolved better parameter values for the previously published okapi bm25 similarity function we have then used genetic programming to evolve completely new similarity functions that do not conform to any predetermined structure we found that the evolved similarity functions outperformed the human developed okapi bm25 function we also found that a detection system using the evolved functions was more accurate than the the best code plagiarism detection system in use today and scales much better to large collections of files the evolutionary computing techniques have been extremely useful in finding similarity functions that advance the state of the art in code plagiarism detection copyright 2008 acm
numerical and statistical methods are used to analyze and classify computer programs both computer source code and object files are examined the results of the application of the pearson and spearman correlation methods to the source code are coupled with the random walk model applied to the binary code one of the practical consequences of the analysis is the ability to quantify the degree of similarity between different computer programs and hence identify cases of plagiarism
aiming at the structure feature of plagiarized source code this paper proposes a kind of visual positioning recognition method based on the function domain mode of source code according to the basic structure feature of source code function domain is taken as the key point of visual recognition in this method the index of each function domain is recorded at first then it applies string matching algorithm at the layer of identifiers to corresponding functions in order to locate the similar areas and build the index map in source codes at last the plagiarism areas are outstanding displayed by heterochromatic mark so as to achieve a visual effect of positioning domain at the same time of visual recognition the system also provides comparison and estimation of different ways practice proved that for the detection of common source code plagiarism in teaching the method can do the visual recognition accurately and the accuracy can reach 90
plagiarism detection is a growing need among educational institutions and solutions for different purposes exist an important field in this direction is detecting cases of source-code plagiarism in this paper we present the tool kato for supporting the detection of this kind of plagiarism in the area of answer-set programming asp currently the tool is implemented for dlv programs but it is designed to handle other logic-programming dialects as well we review the basic features of kato introduce its theoretical underpinnings and discuss an application of kato for plagiarism detection in the context of courses on logic programming at the vienna university of technology
the usage of online submission provides an efficient means of facilitating course components especially those with large enrolment however this convenience is not without caveat as student solutions are then as easily distributed as they submitted for credit while services exist to combat academic dishonesty such as online comparison databases privacy concerns have been raised about their usage we have developed and implemented an entropy based method for the verification of academic integrity this tool was implemented primarily for a freshman undergraduate programming course with a yearly enrolment of more than 1000 students even with significant resources and effort dedicated to ensuring academic integrity the result was difficult to quantify further compounding the challenge was the fact that computer program source code has rigidly defined constructs and syntax thus a simple text comparison could indicate a high level of similarity that might implying a lower level of integrity conversely two logically identical programs could be written with different variable names where a simple text comparison could indicate a higher level of integrity rather than performing a straight comparison our entropy based method generates a symbolic library of the file and then analyses the library structure against all other file libraries as a measure of academic integrity this method defeats the short comings of the aforementioned methods this paper will present our entropy based method and its high level of success verifying the academic integrity of large sets of assignment submissions
learning programming languages and developing software is important part of curricula at many educational institutions directly connected to that is a peer-to-peer sharing of program s source codes which is not always allowed the article discusses the problem of plagiarism especially the source code plagiarism and presents an excerpt of the results of the survey among students at faculty of education and faculty of computer and information science at university of ljubljana and among students at faculty of natural sciences and mathematics at university of maribor results are revealing alarming situation in addition advices for the teachers to avoid the plagiarism as much as possible are presented
learning to program is a complex task and is the reason that many novice programmers plagiarise source code when learning to program there are many automated plagiarism detection tools which have been used to detect the plagiarism of source code typically leading to disciplinary action being taken against students this study investigates whether there is a difference in the plagiarism behaviour of students committing plagiarism for acceptable reasons as compared to unacceptable reasons so that an automated support tool for novice programmers might be viable it was found that the reasons for committing plagiarism are most likely due to a lack of knowledge and that students commit plagiarism as a last resort in many cases it was also found that there were differences between the behaviour of students plagiarising for acceptable and unacceptable reasons below average students plagiarising multiple lines of source code up to a complete method most likely do so for acceptable reasons it was not possible to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable plagiarising behaviour for above average subjects but the plagiarising of multiple classes or files was almost always for unacceptable reasons copyright 2009 acm
plagiarism of digital system designs has become increasingly convenient with the emergence of language-based design techniques detection and proof of plagiarism are similarly facilitated this has long been an issue in computer programming courses and non-technical courses that rely heavily on text based assignments however until recently digital design instruction was based on graphical design methods that did not adapt well to electronic cut-and-paste or web searches tools are needed to encourage and verify the originality of digital designs such tools exist for many programming languages and for essay text but not for hardware description language hdl based digital design in this paper we present an implementation of hdl plagiarism checking that is similar to what is used to evaluate the similarity and ancestry of gene sequences this form of plagiarism screening has been used for one semester in a digital integrated circuit design course other less effective and efficient methods were in use for two years results show a strong sensitivity to commonality between closely related source code files even in the presence of a variety of obfuscation techniques
a source code plagiarism detection engine plaggie is presented it is a stand-alone java application that can be used to check java programming exercises plaggie s functionality is similar with previously published jplag web service but unlike jplag plaggie must be installed locally and its source code is open apparently plaggie is the only open-source plagiarism detection engine for java exercises
the detection of similarities in source code has applications not only in software re-engineering to eliminate redundancies but also in software plagiarism detection this later can be a challenging problem since more or less extensive edits may have been performed on the original copy insertion or removal of useless chunks of code rewriting of expressions transposition of code inlining and outlining of functions etc in this paper we propose a new similarity detection technique not only based on token sequence matching but also on the factorization of the function call graphs the factorization process merges shared chunks factors of codes to cope in particular with inlining and outlining the resulting call graph offers a view of the similarities with their nesting relations it is useful to infer metrics quantifying similarity at a function level
plagiarism in programming assignments is a widespread problem in educational community which has motivated the need of a more efficient robust and faster detection approach than the manual checking the buaa-antiplagiarism system introduced in this paper detects source-code plagiarism through the analysis of program s syntax structure the output of the system is a group of clusters of all suspicious plagiarized programs after calculating the pair wise similarities this system consists of four parts abstract syntax tree generation fingerprints representation similarity measurement and clustering method by testing a set of submissions the comparative evaluation shows that buaa-antiplagiarism system has better performance than jplag a famous plagiarism detection system
the ncp algorithm is developed to detect the cases of plagiarism of source codes algorithm uses tokenize representation of the source code trie-tree to store sequences of tokens and levenshtein distance computation to assess the similarity of two sequences some optimizations are proposed to improve the performance of this algorithm
much research in the plagiarism detection literature relates to attempting to discover which students have copied student source code submissions from one another - a process commonly known as collusion the majority of the collusion literature suggests that structure metrics metrics that look beyond semantics to attempt to find disguise are the most appropriate comparators for finding such collusion this paper contrasts two paired structure metrics with a paired superficial metric the metrics having been identified from the plagiarism detection literature the metrics are compared on a corpus of visual basic source code a programming language that has not been considered previously in the detection literature the results find that the superficial metric considered lancaster word pairs which calculates the proportion of consecutive words in common between two documents more accurately differentiates between collusion and coincidence and can be argued to be the most effective of the metrics this suggests that the premise that structure metrics are the most appropriate methods for automated detection might need to be reconsidered
source code plagiarism is becoming one of the most serious problems in academia there have been many proposed methods that attempt to detect source code plagiarism in programming classes most of them extract algorithmic features from the source code and measure the similarity between them these methods show high levels of accuracy in evaluation experiments and however it is concerning that the similarity detected by the methods might not be caused by plagiarism as a result we propose a method called the cm algorithm which utilizes a student s coding style the way the student writes source code to check whether the source code submitted by the student was produced by him her in this paper we propose a combined method that measures the similarity between source codes by using sim 7 one of the well-known in-class source code plagiarism detection systems and then checks the outputs of sim against our improved cm algorithm the new method is expected to reduce false positives in plagiarism detection systems this paper also gives a detailed explanation of the improved cm algorithm which assumes fluctuations in the source code produced by a student s coding style
our work focuses on detecting plagiarism within a source code corpus the case study is to help a human corrector to find out plagiarism within source code written by computer science students like other approaches we use the notion of similarity distance however in this work we introduce segmentation to split documents into smaller parts and propose a document-wise distance based on the cost of permuting segments to transform one document to another our framework is laid out as a pipeline where each stage can be parameterized to build up a plagirism detector fitting user needs the approach makes no assumption about the programming language being analyzed furthermore it provides a synthetical report of the results to ease the decision making process as we consider that only a human user has final word on wether it is plagiarism or not we tested our framework on hundreds of real source files involving many programming languages allowing us to discover previously undetected frauds
program plagiarism is widespread due to intelligent software and the global internet environment consequently the detection of plagiarized source code and software is becoming important especially in academic field though numerous studies have been reported for detecting plagiarized pairs of codes we cannot find any profound work on understanding the underlying mechanisms of plagiarism in this paper we study the evolutionary process of source codes regarding that the plagiarism procedure can be considered as evolutionary steps of source codes the final goal of our paper is to reconstruct a tree depicting the evolution process in the source code to this end we extend the well-known bioinformatics approach a local alignment approach to detect a region of similar code with an adaptive scoring matrix the asymmetric code similarity based on the local alignment can be considered as one of the main contribution of this paper the phylogenetic tree or evolution tree of source codes can be reconstructed using this asymmetric measure to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the phylogeny construction algorithm we conducted experiments with more than 100 real source codes which were obtained from east-asia icpc international collegiate programming contest our experiments showed that the proposed algorithm is quite successful in reconstructing the evolutionary direction which enables us to identify plagiarized codes more accurately and reliably also the phylogeny construction algorithm is successfully implemented on top of the plagiarism detection system of an automatic program evaluation system

efficient detection of plagiarism in programming assignments of students is of a great importance to the educational procedure this paper presents a clustering oriented approach for facing the problem of source code plagiarism the implemented software called pdetect accepts as input a set of program sources and extracts subsets the clusters of plagiarism such that each program within a particular subset has been derived from the same original pdetect proposes the use of an appropriate measure for evaluating plagiarism detection performance and supports the idea of combining different plagiarism detection schemes furthermore a cluster analysis is performed in order to provide information beneficial to the plagiarism detection process pdetect is designed such that it may be easily adapted over any keyword-based programming language and it is quite beneficial when compared with earlier state-of-the-art plagiarism detection approaches
in this work we introduce a novel method for source code fingerprinting based on frequent pattern discovery using a graph grammar induction system and use it for detecting cases of plagiarism this approach is radically different from others in that we are not looking for similarities between documents but similarities between fingerprints which are made up of recurring patterns within the same source code the advantage to our approach is that fingerprints consist of any part of the text and has no connection to functionality of the code rather it concentrates on the habits of the coder which in most cases will be very hard to identify by a plagiarizer and almost impossible to remove copyright
the paper puts forward a new method to identify similar c codes based on weighted attributes eigenvector according to the characteristics of physical and structure attributes of c codes the weighing theory of attributes eigenvector is adopted to strengthen the infection of attribute elements with covert codes which are based on the theory and method about existing kinds of attribute eigenvector in c codes this can also improve the quality and veracity of the similarity recognition experiments show that the method can identify the integrated similarity with the three aspects of space characters parameter variables and sentence sequences further more comparing with ideal calculating results the measure precision of integrated evaluation can reach to at least 94 in the cases of middle and high similarity
source code documents are vulnerable to being plagiarized as the central component of code plagiarism detection cpd code similarity detection csd attracts more and more attention in this paper we proposed a new method for csd by combining structure metric with semantic computing techniques it is capable of identifying not only the primary cheating means in code copy but also the senior ones such as replacing control structures with equivalent structures we describe the design and implementation of the method and make some comparative experiments against moss and the structure only method experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can obtain more effective similar values of code-pairs
source-code plagiarism detection is an unfortunate but necessary activity when reviewing assignments of programming courses while being reasonably easy to fool string-based comparisons offer a high degree of accuracy with almost no false positives and usually a good string similarity metric is the length of their longest common subsequence in the case of two strings the dynamic programming algorithm for this calculation unfortunately takes quadratic time even if the strings are equal in this paper we present an algorithm that given a batch of source-code files efficiently finds all pairs of similar files by preprocessing the files and then using a fast branch-and-bound algorithm to find only those pairs whose longest common subsequence is indicative of plagiarism
the paper presents a plagiarism detection framework the goal of which is to determine whether two programs are similar to each other and if so to what extent the issue of plagiarism detection has been considered earlier for written material such as student essays for these text-based algorithms have been published we argue that in case of program code comparison structure based techniques may be much more suitable the main idea is to transform the source code into mathematical objects use appropriate reduction and comparison methods on these and interpret the results appropriately we have designed a generic program structure comparison framework and implemented it for the prolog and sml programming languages we have been using the implementation at bute to successfully detect plagiarism in homework assignments for years
in e-learning is very important the checking plagiarism of students homework submissions this paper proposes methods and tools for the plagiarism detection the paper focuses only on the source code plagiarism the analysis phase was the basis for our method proposal which has ambitions to bring something new and to make the plagiarism detection more effective the method was implemented in a tool and its results and advantages are also presented copyright
in academic environments where students are partly evaluated on the assignments it is necessary to discourage the practice of copying assignments of other students the detection of plagiarism in code from large source code repositories manual detection is fairly complex if not impossible therefore for fair evaluation there must be a fast efficient and automatedlsemi-automated way to detect the assignments copied source code metrics can be used to detect the source code plagiarism in programming assignments submitted by university students in this paper we have developed a source code plagiarism detection system and tried to improve the existing techniques by separating the suspected files and the non-plagiarized files thus reducing the dataset for further comparison a number of source code metrics have been calculated combined using similarity detection formula to give an aggregate view of the source code metrics after that the suspected files are separated and then performed string-matching to detect the level of similarity
we propose an adaptive method for detecting plagiarized pairs from a large set of source code this method is adaptive in that it uses an adaptive algorithm and it provides an adaptive threshold for determining plagiarism conventional algorithms are based on greedy string tiling or on local alignments of two code strings however most of them are not adaptive they do not consider the characteristics of the program set thereby causing a problem for a program set in which all the programs are inherently similar we propose adaptive local alignment-a variant of local alignment that uses an adaptive similarity matrix each entry of this matrix is the logarithm of the probabilities of the keywords based on their frequency in a given program set we also propose an adaptive threshold based on the local outlier factor lof which represents the likelihood of an entity being an outlier experimental results indicate that our method is more sensitive than jplag which uses greedy string tiling for detecting plagiarism-suspected code pairs further the adaptive threshold based on the lof is shown to be effective and the detection performance shows high sensitivity with negligible loss of specificity compared with that using a fixed threshold
with the signigicant increase of computer and internet based crimes it becomes increasingly important to have techniques that can be applied in a legal setting to assist the court in making judgements about malware theft of code and computer fraud to better deal with author identification of software we propose a semantic approach to identifying authorship through the comparison of program data flows to do so we compute program dependences compute program similarity if detecting theft of code is needed and thus query about not only the syntactic structure of programs but also the data flow within in order to discriminate authors the experimental result reveals that our technique is more robust even with some intentional code modifications
there has been proliferation in the use of plagiarized articles or source code amongst student and research community this paper focus on an efficient method that can differentiate between plagiarized and non-plagiarized programs similarity distance measurement techniques are used to classify the test file thirty six distance metrics are used to determine intra class and inter class proximity unseen file not used for frequency extraction are predicted with higher accuracy this depict that our proposed model using intra inter family threshold can be implemented to identify plagiarized programs with better detection rate
detecting similarity or plagiarism in the academic research publications source code etc has been a long time complex and time consuming task several algorithms tools and websites exist that try to find plagiarism or possible plagiarism in those human creative products in this paper we used source code plagiarism detection tools to assess the level of plagiarism in source codes we also investigated issues related to accuracy and challenges in detecting possible plagiarism in students assignments in a second study we evaluated some tools against detecting possible plagiarism in research papers results showed that such process or decision is not binary to make and that subjectivity is high in addition there is a need to tune plagiarism detection tools to give criticality or weights by users of those tools to categorize and classify different levels of seriousness for committing plagiarism
learning to program is an important subject in computer science courses during programming exercises plagiarism by copying and pasting can lead to problems for fair evaluation some methods of plagiarism detection are currently available such as sim however because sim is easily influenced by changing the identifier or program statement order it fails to do enough to support plagiarism detection in this paper we propose a plagiarism detection method which is not influenced by changing the identifier or program statement order we also explain our method s capabilities by comparing it to the sim plagiarism detector furthermore we reveal how our method successfully detects the presence of plagiarism
